## Page Notes
## Highlights
- ONNX, short for Open Neural Network Exchange, is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the exchange of neural network models among different deep learning frameworks.The primary goal of ONNX is to break down the barriers between various deep learning frameworks, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different libraries without getting locked into a single ecosystem. It achieves this by defining a common format for representing deep learning models, which can be understood and executed by multiple frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, etc.How ONNX WorksAt its core, ONNX defines a common format for representing deep learning models, referred to as the ONNX model format. This format consists of a computational graph, where nodes represent operations, and edges represent the flow of data. Each node in the graph corresponds to a specific operation, such as convolution, pooling, or activation, and includes attributes that define its behavior. — [Updated on 2024-10-08 10:04:10](https://hyp.is/5kOy_IVLEe-ehTNVwCCYMg/medium.com/@shivprataprai11/understanding-onnx-an-open-standard-for-deep-learning-models-350a72714660) — Group: #Public
