# Nota Diaria - martes, 15 de octubre de 2024
The autodistill model lasts 6 seconds per image with 6 classes. With 18 classes -> 11.33 seconds. Unacceptable

I can still try testing this repo with lighter options, not sure about the results of this.

Apart from this, there is another option to do while I am doing testing with Trt in my script that is trying to add the owlvit pipeline to label in batches of 5k images per 5k of images.
Once I have 5k images, train with that and add some image randomly after, fine tuning the model freezeing the firsts layer and all of that while I try to add TensorRT support to my script.
So:
- [x] Create a script to use Owl Vit 2 + SAM for relabelling in 5k to 5k images
	- [x] Create a formal list of clothes that will be the classes of the model
	- [x] Pass the script to the server and dockerize it (with volumes, gpu support, etc)
- [ ] Start the training once we have 5k images
- [ ] Add TensorRT to the script (https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/nanosam), this repo is SAM but with tensorrt support, maybe is a good option, this is the part that I need:  https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/nanosam?tab=readme-ov-file#example-2---segment-with-bounding-box-using-owl-vit-detections
