# RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

## Overview
RLHF is a technique used to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using human feedback data to better align them with human preferences. This method helps improve model outputs in terms of usefulness, relevance, and safety.

## Key Components

### Core Elements of Reinforcement Learning in RLHF
- **Agent**: The LLM being fine-tuned
- **Environment**: The context window where text can be entered
- **State**: Current context (text) in the context window
- **Action**: The generation of text (words, sentences, or longer content)
- **Action Space**: The model's token vocabulary
- **Reward**: Measurement of how well the output aligns with human preferences

### The Reward Model
- Functions as the central component of the RL process
- Trained on human feedback examples through supervised learning
- Used to evaluate LLM outputs and assign reward values
- Helps scale the process by reducing the need for direct human feedback
- Encodes learned human preferences

## Process Flow
1. Initial model generates outputs
2. Human feedback is collected on these outputs
3. A reward model is trained on this [[Obtaining human feedback]]
4. The LLM is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning, with the reward model providing feedback
5. The process iterates to continuously improve alignment with human preferences

## Benefits and Applications
- Improves model's ability to generate useful and relevant outputs
- Helps minimize potential harm through better alignment
- Can include caveats about limitations
- Reduces toxic language and inappropriate topics
- Potential for personalization through continuous user feedback
   - Could enable individualized learning plans
   - Could power personalized AI assistants

## Implementation Notes
- More complex than traditional RL due to subjective nature of language
- Reward can be binary (0/1) or more nuanced
- Uses "rollouts" instead of "playouts" for action sequences
- Requires careful balance of exploration and exploitation in the learning process
