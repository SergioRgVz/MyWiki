Deep learning has power, flexibility, and simplicity. That's why we believe it should be applied across many disciplines. These include the social and physical sciences, the arts, medicine, finance, scientific research, and many more. Here's a list of some of the tasks oin different areas at which deep learning, or methods heavily using deep learning, is now the best in the world:
- Natural language processing (NLP) Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
- Computer vision Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
- Medicine Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
- Biology Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
- Image generation Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
- Recommendation systems Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
- Playing games Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
- Robotics Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
- Other applications Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much moreâ€¦

Earlier, the traditional machine learning algorithns required that the scientist or programmers look for the relations between the differents features in the dataset, nowadays, the neural networks does that for us, so we do not have to worry about finding the relationship if not on finding the right structure for our neural network.
