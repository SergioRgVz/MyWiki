# Introduction
This is another type of unsupervised learning model. They are algorithms provinding personalized suggestions for items that are most relevant to each user. 

Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stant out significantly from competitors.

There are two major paradigms of recommender system: collaborative and content based methods

## Collaborative filtering methods
Collaborative methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations. These interactions are stored in the "user-item interactions matrix".

This algorithm is uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations, that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B.

This post is so good explaining what collaborative filtering is: https://medium.com/@evelyn.eve.9512/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system-an-overview-38dfa8462b61
Besides, it has gave me an idea for posts on medium, substack and platform like that, you can make a kaggle project to learn and make a post about it but explaining the theory behind what you are doing. That's a good idea
