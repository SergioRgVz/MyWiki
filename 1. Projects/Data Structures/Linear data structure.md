In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement. But when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

Some examples are: 
- [[Array data structure]]
- [[Stack data structure]]
- [[Queue data structure]]
- [[Linked list data structure]]
